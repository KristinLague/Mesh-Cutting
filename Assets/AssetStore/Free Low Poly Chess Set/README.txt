Thank you for downloading the Free Low Poly Chess Set!

SIZE AND SPACING
The board is sized such that each space is 1 unit in size. The pivot for the board is the center of the first space.
The pivot of each piece is located on the bottom center of each model. This makes it easy to align the pieces to the board.
For example, if your pawn is on space C5 and the board was set to world position (0, 0, 0), you would set the pawn's world position to (3, 0, 5).

MATERIALS AND COLORS
Each mesh has a single texture for Ambient Occlusion and can be used with the Unity Standard Shader by applying it
to the Occlusion channel. Changing colors is as simple as changing the Albedo color. You can also create multiple
materials with different colors to swap out at runtime or save on prefabs.
